### Here is a list of the projects I am most proud of:
#### JavaScript
- [German Bible CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/german-bible-cli): A CLI for the German Bible (SCH1951). It has many cool features and aint useless.
- [amos](https://github.com/Sheesher/amos): A discord bot. It can play music and do much more things.

#### Dart
- [Deutsches Meme Soundboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=club.ente.soundboard): The app had had 60K downloads when it was deleted due to the very offensive word "Kanake". It's a soundboard including many famous memes.
